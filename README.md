**Determining` Malicious Files: A Machine Learning Project**

**Authors: Sheli Feigin and Shani Hazan**

This project was done as a final project as part of a Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.

Our task involved assimilating information concerning various attributes of executable files (.exe) and tasked us with constructing a model capable of forecasting the likelihood of a given file harboring malicious intent through a static scrutiny of said files.

This venture revolves around a binary classification challenge wherein we segregated files into dual categories: those deemed malicious (1) and those deemed benign (0), based on the array of features encompassed within the dataset. While certain features are well-defined, others remain anonymous. 

The dataset consisted of 60,000 instances, each classified as either malicious or non-malicious. Rigorous analysis and preprocessing were conducted on the bestowed data, culminating in the selection of an optimal model adept at identifying patterns within unseen test data.

Our efforts yielded a commendable AUC score of 0.9631 in our testing phase. This accomplishment earned us a project evaluation score of 90.

The entirety of this project's documentation, including code and commentary, resides within a Jupyter Notebook scripted in both Python and Markdown.
